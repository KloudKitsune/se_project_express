# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

This backend for the WTWR project was built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** — Web framework for building the REST API
- **MongoDB** — NoSQL database for storing users and clothing items
- **Mongoose** — ODM for MongoDB, used for schema definitions and database queries
- **ESLint (Airbnb Base config)** — Code linting and style enforcement
- **Prettier** — Code formatting
- **Nodemon** — Development tool for automatic server restarts
- **Validator** — Library for validating URLs in schema fields

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
